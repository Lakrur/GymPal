Overhead shrugs are a more suitable alternative for exercisers that find the isolated muscular recruitment pattern of the conventional shrug to be inefficient and time consuming, allowing them to train the entirety of their back and shoulders in a single exercise.", muscleGroup: .traps, presentation: "OverheadShrugs"),
