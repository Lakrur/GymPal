## About

This is an application in which you can see the different exercises for each muscle group in the gym and their correct execution. You can also add your progress to a separate tab and track how you progressed in a certain exercise.

| By selecting a specific muscle group, we can see a list of exercises. For each exercise, a dedicated separate gif-animation and a detailed description of the exercise. | <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOGU4MTk2ZmNjZDBmMzA1NjMzYWNhM2JlM2FjMzM0YjNmM2U5NTEyNiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZzX2dpZklkJmN0PWc/v38n7ikKWyanJxWmh4/giphy.gif" width="300" height="600"> | 
| There are three compartments under the GIF animation. You can enter the number of repetitions and the weight that you performed on a specific exercise and it will be added to the database. For each exercise, you can enter an unlimited number of your results. In the progress tab you will be met by a certain exercise, by clicking on it you will see all your results, by swiping you can delete it from the database | <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZGEyNDljNGM0OTFkZTg0YWJjMzIxMjZhZWIxMTc5MTM4Mzc0YTM5MSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZzX2dpZklkJmN0PWc/lwwQ8BxDWpW2n8dY4Q/giphy.gif" width="300" height="600"> |
